# How to build!

This is a simple showcase on how to edit the project!

1. Get the plugin.cs
2. Get the GT mod template
3. Replace all of the name spaces with LegMod
4. Replace Plugin.CS with the one in here
5. Add Assembly-CSharp, utillia, and unityengine. (There might be some missing so if it does not work add the ones it tells you to add.)
6. Build

Now you should be able to modify it!
